# Background Research, Needfinding, & Interviews

## Finding the Root Issue

#### User Goal:
International students need to find an OPT job in the U.S.

#### Problems/Barriers to this goal:
- People have a lot of trouble finding job opportunities in the first place.
- People don’t seem to know what kind of companies sponsor OPT jobs. Some think that big companies will hire you easily, others think that smaller companies are easier.
- Many companies do not give feedback to applicants (you have no idea if your resume is getting past screenings)
- People feel...
  - helpless because they believe that "American candidates are given preferential treatment", "companies will exploit us because we are just trying to stay in the country", & "we have to prove that we are better than literally anyone else in order to get hired"
  - confused on the subject, asking "How do I search for these companies?", "What am I supposed to do?", & "How do I know which jobs offer OPT?"
  - desperate (to stay in the US)

#### Current solutions to these problems:
- Using Handshake or LinkedIn
- Some people try starting their own nonprofit businesses (LLCs) to stay in the US longer
- Staying in academic longer by applying to grad school
- Researching the job market in one's particular field
- Finding jobs that instead offer an H1B visa
- Lying during job interviews or finding other such loopholes to get hired more easily
- Find state government work
- Networking

#### Root Issue
People don't necessarily want an OPT job, they want to stay in the US post-graduation (Unfortunately some of that is a bit beyond the scope of this project)

## Domain Research

#### Current Applications
- OPT Nation
  - Allows students to search for OPT jobs (right from their front page!)
    - Hard to find stuff in Ohio
  - The front page overwhelms the user with information (very reading intensive & cluttered with images & animations)
  - The section on the front page "Our Services for Candidate" & "Our Services for Employer" do a good job at establishing what is available on the site
    - Includes free & paid services
- United OPT
  - Also allows students to search for OPT jobs (from their front page)
    - As of 2/7 they have exactly one job in Ohio, though some of their searching methods seem inconsistent
  - Very visually crowded & overwhelming, gives the impression of advertising
    - Similar to OPT Nation
- Handshake
  - Has an OPT filter on its job board but otherwise offers no specific information about OPT
    - It is a very popular job finding site, so we should borrow its design conventions as we see fit
  - Requires a log-in

#### What's "good" about current approaches?
- The example sites above have search bars right up front so you can jump in to looking for jobs by location, keywords, etc.
- Offering students OPT-specific information
- Trying to make information less reading-centric & more visual

#### What about the current approaches could use improvement?
- The example websites are very cluttered and overwhelming, buttons everywhere, distracting animations & images, lots of long paragraphs & reading
  - Choice overload!
- Very few jobs in Ohio (not exactly the websites fault, but regardless)
- Students who use them do not understand the requirements of OPT, loopholes you can use, etc. nor do they know much about how to get a job with OPT
- Websites like OPT Nation & United OPT, while more focused on the international student audience, are less known & used (though that is not strictly the fault of the website)

## Interviews

#### Questions

1) Walk us through your current/past job search process
   - Show us what websites you use. What do you like/dislike about those websites?
   - Are there any particular stories or experiences you've had with the job-searching process?
2) What do you know about OPT?
   - Where did you learn this information?
   - What have you learned about the OPT job application process since you started out?
3) Have you sucessfully found an OPT job?
   - If yes, how long did it take you to find a position / how many places did you apply to?
4) Were there things about the OPT system you weren't aware of until after the fact?
5) How has the job-searching process made you feel?
6) Why do you want to get a job in the US/stay in the US?
7) In your opinion, how might we...
   - improve the search process for OPT jobs?
   - improve the visibility of OPT jobs?
   - improve the information visibility related to OPT & Visa?
   - improve the application process for OPT jobs?

#### Common Themes Accross Interviews

**Goals**
- Higher paying job & better career prospects
- Local job opportunities (college or Ohio-based)
- Forming/maintaining networks (local folks, Wooster alum, family, S.O.s, etc.)

**Setbacks**
- Lack/clarity of information
 - Information sources (college events/workshops, family, alumni)
- Focusing on quantity of jobs over quality
- Getting ghosted by employers

**Actions**
- Online resources: Handshake, LinkedIn, Indeed, & Glassdoor
- Determine if a job is “OPT-friendly” (using filters for OPT jobs, position/company research, etc.)
- Build their network
- Build their portfolio
- Saves jobs to lists to apply/review later

**Needs**
- People want well-paying jobs, and the US is a good place for those jobs
- For international students in the US, OPT is the best way to fulfill that goal (especially for STEM majors)
- Information on OPT is hard to find
- Jobs that support OPT are hard to find
