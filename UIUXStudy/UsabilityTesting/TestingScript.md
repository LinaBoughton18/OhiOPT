# Usability Testing Script

## An Explanation & Introduction

Hi, _____. My name is _____, and I’m going to be walking you through this session today.

Before we begin, I have some information for you, and I’m going to read it to make sure that I cover everything.

You probably already have a good idea of why we asked you here, but let me go over it again briefly. We’re asking people to try using a Web site that we’re working on so we can see whether it works as intended. The session should take about 30 minutes. 

The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we’re testing the site, not you. You can’t do anything wrong here. In fact, this is probably the one place today where you don’t have to worry about making mistakes.

As you use the site, I’m going to ask you as much as possible to try to think out loud: to say what you’re looking at, what you’re trying to do, and what you’re thinking. This will be a big help to us.

Also, please don’t worry that you’re going to hurt our feelings. We’re doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions.

If you have any questions as we go along, just ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we’re interested in how people do when they don’t have someone sitting next to them to help. But if you still have any questions when we’re done I’ll try to try to answer them then. And if you need to take a break at any point, just let me know.

These two wonderful people behind/next to us are my fellow teammates on this project, and they’re just going to take some notes as we run the test (remember, they are judging the app, not you!).

Do you have any questions so far?

## Pre-test questions 

OK. Before we look at the site, I’d like to ask you just a few quick questions.

Have you recently gone job-hunting?

What job search websites are you familiar with? 

Are you an international student? How familiar are you with finding work as an international student/recent graduate?

## Home Page Tour

OK, great. We’re done with the questions, and we can start looking at things.

First, I’m going to ask you to look at this page and tell me what you make of it: what strikes you about it, whose site you think it is, what you can do here, and what it’s for. Just look around and do a little narrative.

You can scroll if you want to (or move the mouse around), but don’t click on anything yet.

## Task Scenarios

Scenarios are read off, as shown in tasks & scenarios.

## Thanks & Questions

Thank you, that was very helpful. Observation team, do you have any questions?

Do you have any questions for me, now that we’re done?
